# CatchObjCException
2015-11-01

WHEREAS, apps written in Swift crash when an Objective-C exception is thrown, and

WHEREAS, although developers have been discouraged from the practice of throwing exceptions for many years, both AppKit and Foundation on OS X nevertheless throw exceptions in various places, often in not-especially-exceptional circumstances, and

WHEREAS, Swift 2.1 offers no mechanism whatsoever to avoid having your app crash upon such exception being thrown, and

NOW, THEREFORE, each of the parties hereto (currently "me", "myself", and "I") agree to seek the simplest possible solution to Not Have My Fucking App Crash Whenever The System Frameworks Decide To Throw An Exception (hereafter "NHMFACWTSFDTTAE").
